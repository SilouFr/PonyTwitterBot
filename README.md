# PonyTwitterBot
A bot that posts content from Cheezburger on Twitter

## How to use it
Go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps and create a new app.
Retrieve your API key, API secret key, Access token and Access token secret.
Paste them between the quotes line 13 in the same order.
Execute the code and check the posted content.

## About the project
I developped this project in 2015 and barely made some change.
This code is made for python 2.7 and I guess could be modified a bit to be python 3 compatible.
I know there are some bugs, sometimes nothing is posted on Twitter for whatever reason.

## End
Enjoy
